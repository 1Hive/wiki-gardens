You'll need to provide a little bit more collateral, but you'll get it back if Celeste rules in your favour.

The dispute is now out of your hands. Celeste will draft a decentralised group of Keepers who will decide on whether or not your proposal violates your community's covenant -- the initial ruling will take roughly 7 days.

> **Note:** If either party is unhappy with the initial ruling, they can choose to stake some more collateral and raise the dispute to an even larger group of Keepers. To learn more about the lifecycle of a dispute, [see here](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/keepers/dispute-lifecycle).
