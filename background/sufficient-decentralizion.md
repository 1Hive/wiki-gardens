# Sufficient decentralizion

Gardens are designed to be operationally decentralized and autonomous from day one. 

Based on our interpretation of the “[Hinman Test 11](https://www.lawandblockchain.eu/hinman-test/)” Gardens allow people to take advantage of tokenization while minimizing the risk of being designated as security. 

Anyone can summon a Garden. The Garden summoner, however, does not have any special rights or authority within that community.
