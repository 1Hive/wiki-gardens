# Introduction

Based on the [1hive](https://wiki.1hive.org/) model, Gardens is a framework for a [new kind](on-chain-governance/garden-framework/) of DAO - a [composable](additional-resources/philosophy/composability.md), [sufficiently decentralized](additional-resources/philosophy/sufficient-decentralizion.md), and [self-improving system](https://forum.1hive.org/t/together-we-thrive/1278), limited only by your community's collective imagination.

Communities can use Gardens to launch their own token or, if they prefer, to import a pre-existing ERC-20 token.

From there, they can use whichever tools they prefer to coordinate: [chat rooms](off-chain-governance/social-spaces-discord.md), [forums](off-chain-governance/forum-discourse.md), etc. 

The token will be used as a governance token for deciding [how funds are issued](on-chain-governance/garden-framework/conviction-voting.md) and how meta-governance [parameters are updated](on-chain-governance/decision-voting.md).

In the beginning, we expect mainly software-based projects and online communities to create Gardens, but ultimately we hope this framework can be used for any cause in the public domain.
