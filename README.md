Gardens is an initiative by [1Hive](https://about.1hive.org/docs/dao) to create a template for public communities to coordinate shared resources in a bottom-up fashion. Essentially, we take the best lessons learned by the 1Hive community and allow any DAO to implement them in a plug-and-play fashion. 

Using Gardens, communities can launch their token with their own dynamic issuance policy or use pre-existing ERC-20 token.

To give a new token value, they can provide some Honey to create some initial liquidity during the creation process. They may also convince the 1Hive community to give up some Honey to provide more liquidity. 

From there, they can use whichever tools they prefer to coordinate: chat rooms, forums, etc. Also, the token will be used for deciding how funds are used and how their DAO design is configured. 

We hope that this will encourage contributions and give more opportunities for people to support causes they care about. In addition, since having a say in a Garden is as simple as buying its token, individuals can easily donate and have a stake in a worthy cause they believe in. 

They are then incentivized to further that cause in the hope of increasing the tokenâ€™s value. This feature is not too dissimilar to equity in traditional businesses with significantly less overhead and greater inclusivity. 

In the beginning, it is expected that software-based projects and online communities will create Gardens, but ultimately it is hoped it could be used for any cause in the public domain.
