[1hive](https://wiki.1hive.org/) is the first Garden. The first of its kind of a new kind of DAO - a sufficiently decentralized, self-improving system, limited only by the community's collective imagination.

Gardens is an initiative by [1hive](https://about.1hive.org/docs/dao) to allow anyone to launch such a DAO.

Communities can use Gardens to launch their own token or, if they prefer, to import a pre-existing ERC-20 token.

From there, they can use whichever tools they prefer to coordinate: chat rooms, forums, etc. 

The token will be used as a governance token for deciding how funds are issued and how meta-governance parameters are updated.

In the beginning, we expect mainly software-based projects and online communities to create Gardens, but ultimately we hope this framework can be used for any cause in the public domain.
