  Together, the three pillars of Conviction voting, the Community covenant, and
  Celeste provide a framework for effective on-chain governance

# Three Pillars

A Garden has three main pillars:

1. A novel voting system \(**Conviction voting**\)
2. A decentralised social contract \(**Community Covenant**\)
3. A dispute resolution protocol \(**Celeste**\)

Conviction Voting \(Continous Signal Voting\), Community Covenants \(Aragon Agreements\), and Celeste \(a BrightID integrated Aragon Court\), are perhaps three of the most important pieces of decentralised software ever written.

We believe that, taken together, they allow us to fulfil the promise of effective community-driven on-chain governance.
