  Together, the three pillars of Conviction voting, the Community covenant, and
  Celeste provide a framework for effective on-chain governance

# Three Pillars

A Garden has three main pillars:

1. A novel voting system \(**Conviction voting**\)
2. A decentralised social contract \(**Community Covenant**\)
3. A dispute resolution protocol \(**Celeste**\)

Taken together, they fulfill the promise of effective community-driven, on-chain governance. Not tomorrow, but today.

## **In sum**

Gardens provides a beautiful foundation for public communities to coordinate around shared resources in a bottom-up fashion.

By combining three of the most important pieces of decentralised software ever written – Conviction Voting\(Continous Signal Voting\), Community Covenants \(Aragon Agreements\), and Celeste \(a BrightID integrated Aragon Court\), we are able to fulfill the promise of effective community-driven on-chain governance, not tomorrow, but today.

With these building blocks, we now have essentially limitless abilities for completely decentralised, and completely autonomous organisations.

## **Notes**

1. Rather than relying entirely on majority rule decision-making, resource allocation decisions are regulated by staking on proposals to accumulate conviction over time. This allows resources to be allocated fairly, while minimizing the political and divisive process of coming to consensus on a single course of action.
2. Covenants are the bridge between a Garden organisation and Celeste \(the dispute resolution mechanism\).
3. Well-reasoned [cryptoeconomic incentives](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/keepers/dispute-lifecycle) ensure that the keepers converge to the most reasonable outcome for the dispute.
4. It’s important to note that Celeste can be used to rule on disputes arising over _any_ human readable English document that allows for the possibility of subjective outcomes, not just a Covenant. For example, you could use it to decide on whether work, as outlined in a funding proposal, was actually completed or not.
5. Celeste acts as a check on the power of _all_ individuals – even highly-trusted community members. In doing so, it protects the long-term integrity of the DAO.
