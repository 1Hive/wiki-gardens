  Together, the three pillars of Conviction voting, the Community covenant, and
  Celeste provide a framework for effective on-chain governance

# The Three Pillars

A Garden has three main pillars:

1. A novel voting system \([**Conviction voting**](conviction-voting.md)\)
2. A decentralised social contract \([**Community Covenant**](covenant.md)\)
3. A dispute resolution protocol \([**Celeste**](celeste.md)\)

[Conviction Voting](https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad), Community Covenants \([Aragon Agreements](https://twitter.com/aragonproject/status/1272954461179215872)\), and Celeste \(a [BrightID](https://twitter.com/BrightIDProject) integrated [Aragon Court](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court)\), are perhaps three of the most important pieces of decentralised software ever written.

We believe that, taken together, they allow us to fulfil the promise of effective community-driven on-chain governance.
