# The Funding Allocation Problem

The process of allocating funds in DAOs today feels very slow and cumbersome, typically requiring a series of yes/no votes evaluated independently.

As a result, most DAOs suffer from a number of important challenges like 51% attacks, low participation, and an overall inability to effectively prioritise and decide when there are many potential options all competing for consideration at once.

[Conviction voting](../../on-chain-governance/garden-framework/conviction-voting.md) provides an elegant solution to this problem.
