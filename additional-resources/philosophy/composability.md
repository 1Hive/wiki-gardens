# Composability

Gardens are composable! 

You can have a main Garden as the core of an ecosystem, but then also spin up derivative Gardens that use the tokens of the main DAO as the collateral/currency for the derivative DAOs. 

This creates an ecosystem of Gardens orgs that are connected to the main org \(giving participants a stake in the ecosystem\), while also allowing each Garden to focus on its own goals and use cases.

You can also have another DAO framework at the core of your ecosystem, and a Garden at the edges. For example, within 1hive we have derivative DAOs that use Gnosis, Colony, and Aragon.
