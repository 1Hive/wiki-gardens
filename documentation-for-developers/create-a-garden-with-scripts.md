# Create a Garden with scripts

## Setup

Clone the Gardens repo:

```text
git clone https://github.com/1Hive/gardens
cd gardens
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Go to the hardhat package:

```text
cd packages/hardhat
```

Compile contracts:

```text
yarn compile
```

Create a `.env` file with the configuration of your wallet and Ethereum node for the network you are interacting with. In the repo, you will find a `.env.example`. 

In case you want to use a hardware wallet we recommend using the [Frame](https://frame.sh) wallet. Remember to run the script with the `frame` the network defined in the `hardhat.config.ts` file.

The account used to create the garden must contain the necessary amount of Honey to lock in a Honeyswap pair, at least $100 worth, specified in the parameters below. If creating a Native Token Garden with a token GDN, the Honey will be locked in the HNY/GDN pair. If creating a Pre-existing Token Garden with a token OGT, some of the community existing token OGT must also be available in the account, specified in the parameters below, and this will be locked in the HNY/OGT pair. The LP tokens for this liquidity are burnt.

If you would like to test on Rinkeby, use the [HNYT token](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x3050e20fabe19f8576865811c9f28e85b96fa4f9). You can exchange it on Uniswap for the Rinkeby network.

## Configure Garden Parameters

The Garden parameters are configured in a file with the name `params-<network>.json` where `<network>` is the network configured in the `hardhat.config.ts` file \(this is the network used to execute the deployment script during the Garden creation\).

The JSON file is formatted as follows:

```javascript
{
  "gardenTokenName": "Garden",
  "gardenTokenSymbol": "GDN",
  "seeds": {
    "0xb4124cEB3451635DAcedd11767f004d8a28c6eE7": 2.5,

  },

  "voteExecutionDelayDays": 0.000694445
}

```

Let's unpack the above configuration.

### Type Of Garden

First, you have to decide [which type of Garden is the best fit for you](../garden-modes.md).

If you decide to deploy **Native Token Garden** you have to set the:

* **Existing token:** must be the zero address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* **Garden token name:** the name of the new token that will be created.
* **Garden token symbol:** the symbol of the new token that will be created.
* **Seeds:** a list of addresses that will be minted the specified amount of tokens.
* **Common pool amount:** the ****number of tokens that will be minted to the common pool.
* **Honey token liquidity in xDai:** the honey deposit quantified in terms of xdai - must be at least 100 or the garden creation will revert.
* **Garden token liquidity:** the ****initial number of tokens that will be used to [create a pair in Honeyswap](../requirements/honeyswap.md) with HNY.

If you decide to deploy **Bring Your Own Token Garden** you have to choose:

* **Existing token:** must be the address of the community's current ERC20 token.
* **Garden token name:** the name of the new token received when wrapping the existent. We recommend following the convention: Existing `Token Name` -&gt; `Garden Token Name` eg `Honey` -&gt; `Garden Honey`
* **Garden token symbol:** the symbol of the new token received when wrapping the existing token. We recommend following the convention: `TKN` -&gt; `gTKN`.
* **Existing token liquidity:** the ****initial number of tokens that will be used to [create a pair in Honeyswap](../requirements/honeyswap.md) with $100 worth of HNY.

### Community Covenant

As we explained in the [three pillars section](../on-chain-governance/garden-framework.md#community-covenant-to-encode-values), the Covenant will be one of the pillars of your community. Take your time to encode your community's values in it. Once you have it ready you should upload it with a markdown format to the [IPFS network](https://ipfs.io). We recommend using a pinning service like [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to keep the content pinned and accessible. 

Following you can see a couple of examples:

* [1Hive's Covenant](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfWppqC55Xc7PU48vei2XvVAuH76z2rNFF7JMUhjVM5xV)
* [Agave's Covenant](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfPADUzzPTda8LZsqQwpfquzG3awt8pFoCB2BQAuvEyFV)
* [Giveth's Covenant](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmarPWD4MQMKrh6aqBHo5n8PvqYocu6z6JczzkGwi9XHsm)

Now you can fill in the next parameters:

* **Agreement title:** A title for the Covenant.
* **Agreement content:** IPFS hash uploaded of the Covenant content, with the format `ipfs:<hash>`.

### Aragon Apps Initialization

The rest of the parameters are the initial configuration for the [Dynamic Issuance](https://github.com/1Hive/issuance), [Conviction Voting](https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-app), [Agreements](https://github.com/1Hive/agreement), and [Disputable Voting](https://github.com/1Hive/disputable-voting) Aragon apps. We recommend leaving the default configuration in most cases. To discuss this topic more in detail reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/d5XyGkA5uF).

```javascript
{ 
  "issuanceTargetRatio": 0.3,
  "issuanceThrottle": 0.1,
  "convictionGrowthHours": 48,
  "spendingLimit": 0.1,
  "minimumConviction": 0.025,
  "minActiveStakePercentage": 0.2,
  "requestToken": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "agreementTitle": "1Hive Community Covenant",
  "agreementContent": "ipfs:QmfWppqC55Xc7PU48vei2XvVAuH76z2rNFF7JMUhjVM5xV",
  "settlementPeriod": 3,
  "proposalDeposit": 0.1,
  "challengeDeposit": 0.1,
  "proposalDepositStable": 100,
  "challengeDepositStable": 100,
  "voteSupportRequired": 0.5,
  "voteMinAcceptanceQuorum": 0.1,
  "voteDurationDays": 0.002083334,
  "delegatedVotingPeriodDays": 0.00138889,
  "voteQuietEndingPeriodDays": 0.000694445,
  "voteQuietEndingExtensionDays": 0.00068288,
  "voteExecutionDelayDays": 0.000694445
}
```

For more detailed explanations of these parameters [see here](apps/).

## Script Execution

Once you are happy with the parameters. Execute the following yarn command:

```text
yarn newdao --network <network>
```

May take a couple of minutes. You should expect an output similar to:

```text
âžœ npx hardhat run scripts/new-dao.ts --network rinkeby

```

## Include Your Metadata

Now that you have deployed a new Garden on-chain you should add your own data and assets to the Gardens website. To do it, create a PR in the [`dao-list` repository](https://github.com/1Hive/dao-list).

The format of the data you need to include:
