# Composability

Gardens are composable! 

You can have a main Garden as the core of an ecosystem, but then also spin up derivative Gardens that use the tokens of the main DAO as the collateral/currency for the derivative DAOs. 

This creates an ecosystem of Gardens orgs that are connected to the main org \(giving participants a stake in the ecosystem\), but also allow each Garden to focus on itâ€™s own goals and use cases.
