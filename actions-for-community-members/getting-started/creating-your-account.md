# Create Your Account

If it's your first time visiting a Garden you should make a profile so your fellow community members can recognise who you are. Gardens uses 3box's IDX identity software to create your decentralized, digital identity which will be associated with your Ethereum address. You can learn more about IDX on [their website](https://idx.xyz/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you create a digital identity with IDX it becomes associated with your Ethereum address over all platforms and Ethereum Networks that implement IDX software. 
{% endhint %}

To create your profile start by logging into Gardens with your Web3 wallet and click on your Ethereum address in the top right corner. Select `My Profile` from the drop down menu.

![You can find your profile from almost any page in the Gardens](../../.gitbook/assets/findMyProfile.png)

On your profile page click `Edit Profile` to begin filling in information to identify yourself. Add your name, a bit about yourself and your Twitter or Github handle if you choose. 

> Note that you are free to fill everything in pseudonymously.

We also recommend using [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) to verify your humanity - it allows you to identify pseudonymously.
