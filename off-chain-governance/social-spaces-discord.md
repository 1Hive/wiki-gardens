# Social spaces \(discord\)

Discord has become the de facto venue where people can learn about a protocol, meet community members and discover ways to participate in the network.

We expect most Gardens to use it extensively.

## Member roles

Discord has a [roles feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101) which allows a community to assign roles to different types of members. These roles can be used to grant permissions such as access to channels or moderation powers.
