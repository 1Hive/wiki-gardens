# Social Spaces \(Discord\)

[Discord](https://discord.com/) has become the de facto venue where people can learn about a protocol, meet community members and discover ways to participate in the network.

We expect most Gardens to use it extensively.

## Member roles

Discord has a [roles feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101) which allows a community to assign roles to different types of members. These roles can be used to grant permissions such as access to channels or moderation powers.



## Channel Structure

> In the beginning, there was \#general... ...but soon after came \#off-topic and \#crafting. Channels flourished and the Server grew. The Admin said "let me sort mine channels!" and Discord said "mine robo-hamsters shall make it so."

Channels can be grouped into categories. And categories, like channels, can be given their own permissions.

Taken together, channels and categories allow you to shape the architecture of your discord.
