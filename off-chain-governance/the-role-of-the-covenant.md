# The role of the Covenant

### Off-chain enforcement <a id="off-chain-enforcement"></a>

You can use the Covenant to create behavioural expectations within Community spaces such as Discourse, and Discord.

For example, here's an extract from the 1hive covenant:

> Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
