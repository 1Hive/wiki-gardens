  We believe it is just as important for DAOs to cultivate the spaces and
  conditions for informal exchanges alongside their formal governance processes.

# Introduction

While effective on-chain governance indues the DAO with resilience, it is in[ Discord chats](social-spaces-discord.md) and [forum debates](forum-discourse.md) that ideas for [proposals](proposal-template.md) are generated and developed through conversation and, at time, healthy disagreement.

The informal exchanges that unfold through these channels are key for growing engagement and participation. They are also essential to ensuring the community can come to the best possible decisions.

In particular, it should be rare for a proposal to be put forward to a vote without extensive prior discussion occurring, both on discord and discourse.
