# Create a Garden \(non-technical\)

Inspired by the [Aragon onboarding wizard](https://rinkeby.client.aragon.org/#/), we are working on a Gardens wizard to allow anyone to summon a Garden in a few minutes -- no code required.

It's not quite ready yet, so please reach out to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/M2EVG4MfR4) and drop us a message in the `#gardens` channel. We will be more than happy to help set one up for you.
